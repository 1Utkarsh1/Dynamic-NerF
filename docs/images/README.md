# Documentation Images

This directory contains images used in the project documentation.

## Required Images

The following images should be placed in this directory:

1. `dynamic_nerf_example.png` - An example rendering from the Dynamic NeRF model
2. `results_comparison.png` - A comparison of results from different methods or settings
3. `model_architecture.png` - A diagram of the Dynamic NeRF model architecture
4. `training_curve.png` - A graph showing training progress

## Image Guidelines

- Images should be in PNG format for best quality
- Recommended resolution: 1200x800 pixels or higher
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 1MB per image)
- Use clear, high-contrast visuals that are easy to understand
- Include captions or labels within the images where appropriate

## Placeholder Images

If you don't have actual result images yet, you can create placeholder images with tools like:
- GIMP
- Photoshop
- PowerPoint
- Online diagram tools like draw.io

Remember to replace placeholder images with actual results once they are available.
